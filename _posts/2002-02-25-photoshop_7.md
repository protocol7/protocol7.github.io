Adobe has finally [released](http://www.macworld.com/2002/04/features/photoshop/) some stuff on Photoshop 7. The big news are Mac OSX support, the healing brush (automatically removes small scratches from the image), a file browser and a few changes to the web tools. Nothing really dramatic if your a PC user but they keep making minor steps towards perfection.

But why not:  
SVG export (texts and paths as vector, the rest as bitmaps)  
SVG import  
Integration with non-Adobe programs (such as Homesite)
