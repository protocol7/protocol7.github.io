Yesterday we finally launched and announced [svg.org](http://www.svg.org), what we hope will be a good community site for all things SVG. Currently we're still beta testing it and will add more features and time goes by.

The wiki has moved and a bunch of people have their blogs there and in a few weeks there will be tutorials and more.

Welcome!
