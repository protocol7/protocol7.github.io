Inspired by [Mårtens food blog](http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/matjournalen/), I'm going to start posting my own experiences into the fine art of eating. I guess it will be mostly about cheese and fine beer, but you never know :-)

So, to start of. Almost every weekend Eva and me stroll down to the cheese store on [Linnégatan](http://www.linnegatansost.se). This weekend was no different. Waiting for consumtion this time is:

- a [Chimay with Beer](http://www.chimay.com/en/chimay_with_beer_246.php), a cheese made by the Trappist monks famous for the Chimay beer. This variant is washed with that very beer, giving it a particular taste
- Blå get from Lillängen
- [Reblochon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reblochon)
- Last but not least, a beatiful piece of Ubriaco di Amarone. The Ubriaco is a hard cheese made from cow milk which is washed with [Amarone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarone), a strong, tasty red wine.
