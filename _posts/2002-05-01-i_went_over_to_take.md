I went over to take a closer look at [DomAPI](http://domapi.com). They got some really impressive stuff there (look at the [examples](http://domapi.com/examples)). It's to bad that they have not gone with an approach that will degrade in older browsers, but that might something coming in future versions (at least for some of the widgets).
