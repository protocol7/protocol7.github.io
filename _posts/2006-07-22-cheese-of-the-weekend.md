Time for an update on this weekend's cheese choice.

- Some left over [Valdeon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valde%C3%B3n_cheese), a Spanish blue cheese made from cow and goat's milk. Still wrapped in chestnut leaves. Quite tasty and very smooth.
- A brie made from goat's milk.
- A big piece of [Taleggio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taleggio_cheese), this is Eva's favorite.
- [Itche Bai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itche_Bai), a French miced ewe and goat's milk hard cheese. Excellent taste, lingers for a long time in the mouth after eaten. And we're [not alone in enjoying it](http://www.ragazze.se/2006/02/06/en-alldeles-vanlig-onsdagsmiddag/)(in Swedish).

For todays breakfast at [NÃ¶ller](http://www.nollerab.com/) I went for a ciabatta with Taleggio and cloudberry jam. For me a surprising but very tasty combination.
