W3C just released the first working draft for [XHTML 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20020805/). It's a bit lacking (such as the list of differences to XHTML 1.1) but there are few noticable things:

- it's not intended to be backwards-complatible
- self-contained, no more HTML 4.01 pointers
- got elements for simple version control of a document (\<del\>, \<ins\>)
- will use [XFrames](http://www.w3.org/2002/Talks/www2002-xhtml/slide19-0.html)
- forget \<br\>, learn \<line\>
- Microsoft is not one of the editors

Summary: looks like W3C wants to make XHTML simpler and redesign legacy problems from HTML.
