Just upgraded to [Wordpress 2.0](http://wordpress.org/download/). In total (removing 1.5 files, copying over the 2.0 files and the running the upgrade script) it took maybe 7 minutes. The theme and plugins all seem to work as expected. All data and configuration is just like before. That's how simple an upgrade should be. Kudos to the [Wordpress team](http://wordpress.org/about/)!

Now I gonna see how the new spam filter support is working. Reports seem to be optimistic.
