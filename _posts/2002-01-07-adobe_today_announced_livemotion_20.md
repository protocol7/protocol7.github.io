Adobe today [announced](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200201/20020107livemotion.html) LiveMotion 2.0. Many people, including me, belived that LM2.0 would include full support for interactive SVG. But, no, LiveMotion will only publish .swf files. That's a huge disappointment for the entire SVG community and I think it's a bad step for Adobe to take. There is a huge interests in standards and XML at the moment, and Adobe has been very succesful with promoting SVG as a open, XML based alternative to Flash.

But at least, LM2.0 seems to be a very nice IDE for Flash. Maybe even better then Macromedias. LM1.0 was the worst software so far, let's hope this version is much better.
