[Geronimo, the Apache J2EE project has released it's first state of the project address](http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=11423). Judging from the report and the activity and quality on the [mailing list](http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=140) it looks really promising. [Rickard Ã–berg seems](http://www.theserverside.com/home/thread.jsp?thread_id=21311#94927) to think so too.
