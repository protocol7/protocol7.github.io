If you're using Subversion (most developers probably are these days) and you're on Windows, you probably use [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/). It's arguably the best SVN client for Windows. And now it's even better, with [this snappy Firefox plugin](http://www.pumacode.org/projects/tsvnmenu) you get the TSVN menus in the web frontend of your SVN repository. I tend to use Firefox for surfing around repositories and then switch to the [TSVN repository browser](http://tortoisesvn.net/node/214) to do any work, now I don't need to. A great time saver.
