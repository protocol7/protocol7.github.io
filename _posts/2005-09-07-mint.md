I immediatelly fell for the pressure and bought [Mint](http://www.haveamint.com), the hyped site statistics app from [Shaun Inman](http://www.shauninman.com/plete/). Bought (via PayPal), downloaded and installed, all within five minutes. So far I've only used it for an hour so it's way to early to tell how it will work out but here are some intial reflections.

The AJAX based GUI is very slick. I would like to be able to provide links to the individual portlets.

Pepper, the plugin interface is easy to use. I installed the UserAgent 007 plugin in less than a minute and it instantly started collecting data.

Now, its going to be interesting to see if a plugin community evolves around Mint.
