There is currently a [huge discussion](http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200201/threads.html) on XQuery on xml-dev. The things is that the proposed format for XQuery is a total mixture of XML and non-XML, making it a mess. So, the options, I think is to either make it XML (like XSL) or non-XML (like XPath)... I would like the first... XSL is so clear and obvious when working with it.

This discussion will go on for days :-)
