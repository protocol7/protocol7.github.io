Five months ago it happened, that little pink line showing that Eva was pregnant. Today, we're getting close to the date that will change our life forever. November 28th is the predicted date, I've put my money on December 3rd.

The image above shows the ultrasound picture when Mini (that's the working name while we fight out the real name) was 14 weeks old.

The pram have been bought, tiny clothes are starting to pile up and the grand mothers (and grand grand mothers) are excited. So, everything is going just great. Now, if I only had a clue to how to handle a small baby. But I'm hoping that it will all fall into place as we get there :-)
