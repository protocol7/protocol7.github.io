[Looks like Burton thinks REST will go mainsteam in the next couple of years](http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1256796,00.html?track=NL-110&ad=590742&asrc=EM_NLN_1507744&uid=5532089). Given that we've been feed that protocol independence and stuff like WS-MEX, ERPs and WS-Trust was really important, it's interesting to see the big guys now thinking REST is the next big thing. Did we all of a sudden realize that all that cruft wasn't all that crucial anyways?

Tool vendors is getting into REST. I guess any support is a nod of approvement, but given the focus on code-first, remote invocation, ignore-the-network frameworks that rules the WS-\* world, I keep my hopes low for the near future. Please convince me otherwise, in the meantime a [good HTTP client](http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/), [XOM](http://www.xom.nu/) and&nbsp; [Restlets](http://www.restlet.org/) will be sufficient.
