Just found [this article by Eric Gunnerson on unit testing in .NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncscol/html/csharp03202003.asp "Working with C#"). I can't empasize enough the importance of writing good unit tests. I've spent the last two months adding a total of 562 tests for the SVG# code. Couldn't live without it.
