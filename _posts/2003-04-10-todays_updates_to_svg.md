Today was another pretty good day on the SVG# (our native .NET SVG implementation) project. I uploaded [our new site](http://www.sharpvectors.org), implemented inherited gradients, finished up the basic shapes module with support for dynamic updates, wrote some more tests and fixes two bugs.

Tomorrow: patterns.
