Macromedia has [released a beta of a new Flash Player](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106797/2002/07/02.html), codenamed Airwolf. The changes are impressive:

- Full scripting support on all Netscape versions
- Support for MP3 ID3 tags
- Masking of device fonts finally works
- Better performance
- and many more things...

Nice work Macromedia!
