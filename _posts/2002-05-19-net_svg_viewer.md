Last night I started to play around with creating a SVG viewer as a .Net WinForms control. A few hours later it supported most of the path commands, a few basic shapes, stroke and fill. This is the first screenshot from it:  
[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/svgviewer_screen1_thumb.gif)](blogs/svgviewer_screen1.gif)  
More and more support for the spec will come, when the Sharp Vector Graphics projects get's going (if ever...) the viewer might also get support for dynamic stuff (animation, scripting).

If you would like to help out, [send me](mailto:niklas@protocol7.com) an e-mail
