Looks like [QCon London this March has been announced](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/11/qcon-london). Quite a few of the tracks look similar to the much hyped QCon San Fransisco a few weeks back.

Since almost the entire company is going to the conference, I hoping for the best possible content. From the track summaries, you'll be likely to find me in the tracks covering [Architectures You've Always Wondered About](http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=82), [The Cloud as the New Middleware Platform](http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=95) (finally getting to see one of my favorites, Gregory Hohpe) and [SOA, REST and the Web](http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=87) (will be interesting to see if [Stefan](http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/) can top the SF line-up).

So far, the list of speakers is quite short, but I guess most of the usual suspects will be coming.

Expect me to blog as much as I can from the conference. See you there!
