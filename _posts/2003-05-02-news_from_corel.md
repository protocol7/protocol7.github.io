Oh, I almost forgot this one. Corel released the final version of [SmartGraphics Studio](http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Corel/Products/productInfo&id=1042152819585) and their [SVG viewer](http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Corel/Products/productInfo&id=1042152911529&did=1042152819585) yesterday. I've tried them both out during the beta, it's interesting stuff. I really hope it will turn out successful for Corel, they sure deserve it.
