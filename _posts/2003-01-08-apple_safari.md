Apples releases the beta for their new browser - [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/#). There was much rumours on an Apple browser after David Hyatt left the Netscape and the Mozilla project to start working for Apple, but Safari is instead based on [Konqueror](http://www.konqueror.org/). This will probably be a critical blow to IE for Mac, which is just fine for me.

Apple also [confirmed to KDE](http://lists.kde.org/?l=kfm-devel&m=104197092318639&w=2) that they will be participating in the open-source project. They also posted the [change log from KHTML to Safari.](http://lists.kde.org/?l=kfm-devel&m=104196912316326&w=2)
