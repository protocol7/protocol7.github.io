[XML Spy Visual Studio .NET Add-in Beta](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/2002/10/15.html#a55), adds a toolbar in VS.NET with the most important XML Spy features. So far so good, but then, as soon as you do something it will still open XML Spy. I want the result of the XSLT transform in VS.NET, that was teh reason for having installing the add-in from the beginning. Crap. Hopefully they will change it during the beta.
