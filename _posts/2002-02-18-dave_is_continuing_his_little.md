[Dave](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/17#hurdlesCssMustOvercome) is continuing his little personal war against CSS. This might turn out to be a long story... to comment on his hurdles:

1. Agree, but this is not a major problem I think. What's important is to get a big sites that really matter to change their structure. The smaller, already crappy, sites I don't really care that much about.

2. I think this is the best point made by Dave. ALA, or some other people should really do this. It will be a really Good Thing for CSS.

3. Of course, the browsers **should** support tables. That's not the issue here.

4. That's not either HTML nor CSS. That's maybe SVG your talking about Dave. And that's a very different story. And in Mozilla you can already do that, mix SVG and XHTML in the same document.

5. Limited browser support and knowledge among blog-developers should not be blamed on CSS.
