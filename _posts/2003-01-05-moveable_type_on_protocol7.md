Today I finally got rid of Blogger and set up [Moveable type](http://www.moveabletype.org). I couldn't be more happy with it so far. Fits my needs perfectly and was very fast to set up. More features (comments, trackback, search) will be coming in the next few days.

The bad news: old permalinks won't work anymore. I hate to do this but I really don't want to keep two copies of all blogs and Blogger differs so much from Moveable type that I have been unable to find a way to keep the old links. :-(
