Jon Udell has some [very exciting news on Word 11](http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/07/13.html). If he's right, Word will be able to edit and validate XML. This will mean a huge difference as documents with actual markup will come into the hands of real people. Also, it' s a clear indication where Microsoft is going when it comes to formats. I wonder how long before we see SVG as their graphics format instead of WMF.
