On [Mr Jabber, Peter Saint-Andre's blog](http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2005-08.html#2005-08-26T19:17), I found a real gem, [CACert](http://www.cacert.org/). CACert is a community for issuing certficates for free. By using a distributed network of assures (we have two here in Gothenburg for example) I can get enough points to get a valid certificate for my identity. And, if I get further assurance points, a will be able to assure others and help spread the network.

I've previsously used [Thawte Web of Trust](http://www.thawte.com/wot/) which works in the same manner, however I do like the openess and simplicity of CACert. I've not been assured by the two guys here in Gothenburg and is waiting for them to enter my points. After that, I can get my personal certificate.

The only main issue with CACert right now is that the [CACert root certificate](http://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3) is not included in the main products (Windows, IE, Mozilla) yet. This means that without verifying and installing the root certificate manually, people will not be able to trust my certificate.
