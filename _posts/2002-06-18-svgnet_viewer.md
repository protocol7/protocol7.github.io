Fixed some of the missing stuff and made a few bugfixes tonight. The viewer now passes the following tests in the [SVG test suite](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20011026/toc-ps.html):

- some structure tests
- most coordinate system, transformation and units tests
- all paths tests
- all basic shapes test
- a few color tests

hey, it's slowly getting there. A few more things and it's ready for a 0.1 release.
