I spent some time this weekend cleaning up [my del.icio.us bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/protocol7). I have a decent, but not huge collection (616 links) and I find that every few months it's a good thing to clean up duplicate tags (relax\_ng vs relaxng), improve bundles and fix some misspelled tags. This time I also rearranged some of my tagging conventions. As most users, I add as many tags as makes sense for a certain link. I find the suggestions made by del.icio.us to be quite good and frequently choose among them.

Articles or blog posts I now tag with the author with the "by:" tag prefix, e.g. [by:elliotte\_rusty\_harold](http://del.icio.us/protocol7/by:elliotte_rusty_harold). I find this a good way of keeping track of writing by my favorite authors.

I use the [natively supported "for:" prefix](http://del.icio.us/help/for) to send [links to friends who also use del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/protocol7/for:deeva). I still got to gather some more experience on this but so far it looks good. I like to minimal approach del.icio.us takes to this type of functionality.

Links which are not HTML pages, especially PDFs, gets tagged with a "format:" prefix, e.g. [format:pdf](http://del.icio.us/protocol7/format:pdf). This serves mostly as a hint/warning for myself while browsing my links. As linking to special formats like SVG might increase, this might be a good way of locating all of these at the same time.

Links which require some attention from me, gets a "to:" prefix. Currently, there are two of these, [to:read](http://del.icio.us/protocol7/to:read) and [to:wish](http://del.icio.us/protocol7/to:wish), but I expect further types in the future, e.g. to:blog for stuff I want to comment in my blog.

Since I spend a lot of time with different open source tools, lots of my links are for different OSS projects. As licenses are of great importance in this world, I've created a "license:" prefix, e.g. [license:gpl](http://del.icio.us/protocol7/license:gpl). I haven't really started using this yet (only one link) but I hope it will be useful.

As seen above, I use different prefixes for special types of tags. So far I find it a very good practice and I expect to define further prefixes as I go along. A _de facto_ convention for these types of tags would be great. For example, if everyone would be using the by: prefix, finding all articles by an author, spread over different sites, would be very simple. Does anyone know of such a conventions that people use (it seems like some of the prefixes I use also get's used by others, e.g. [license:gpl](http://del.icio.us/tag/license:gpl))? I would certainly be happy to switch to whatever is the majority choice. If not, how would one establish such a convention in the best way?
