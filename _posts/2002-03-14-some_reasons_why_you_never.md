some [reasons](http://www.infinitemonkeys.ws/infinitemonkeys/articles/javascript/977.asp) why you never should use eval(). I agree on everyone of them. eval() is the worst single thing about JavaScript and is in every case the worst option to use. Even for dynamic code execution there are better algorithms.
