My all-time favorite HTML editor will no longer be developed. Instead it's now an integral part of Dreamweaver MX, and it's done in a pretty good way from what I've seen in the preview release.

[John Dowdell](http://jdmx.blogspot.com) got the news: "Some Homesite folks wanted Homesite to change and advance in some ways too, but this won't happen, sorry. Dreamweaver MX is now the common path, incorporating elements from Dreamweaver 4.0, Dreamweaver UltraDev, Homesite, ColdFusion Studio, and JRun Studio."
