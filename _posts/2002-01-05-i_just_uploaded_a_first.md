I just uploaded a first [example](http://www.protocol7.com/default.asp?x=projdoc/p7_xmlrpc_svg) of the code documentation we will be using here on protocol7. It uses this [XML source](http://www.protocol7.com/default.asp?x=projdoc/p7_xmlrpc_svg&a=xml) (a slightly modified version of the youngpup format). Currently I've only made XSL stylesheets for javascript objects but other types of components will be coming as well (services, CSS and maybe more). All code will be made freely available soon :-)
