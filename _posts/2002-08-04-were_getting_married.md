[Mark](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/03.html#wedding_sites) is having problems deciding on where to get married.

Me and Eva is getting married in two weeks, so we're getting pretty excited and nervous now. The actuall wedding will take place in this [church](http://m1.317.telia.com/~u31712055/kungalv/images/KiGbg10.jpg) here in Goteborg and then we'll have the party in this [old fortress](http://www.hd.chalmers.se/~d97ahjo/Bilder/Andra%20bilder/Skansen%20kronan/pages/IMG_0027.htm). Gonna be pretty cool :-)

Wish us luck, it's getting close!
