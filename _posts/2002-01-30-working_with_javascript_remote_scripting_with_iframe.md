[Remote Scripting with IFRAME](http://developer.apple.com/internet/javascript/iframe.html). A basic article on remote scripting. On XML-RPC: "down side is that it takes a bit more know-how and work to get it up and running". That's a failure of the libraries if that's true, I don't think it is.

But he's very much right that there is no support for XML-RPC in IE Mac (as far as I know). Who will be the first to fix that?
