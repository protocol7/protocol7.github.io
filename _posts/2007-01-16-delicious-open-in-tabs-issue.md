I'm a heavy user of the [del.icio.us extension for Firefox](http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension). One thing I really love is to open up the boomarks (click the checker button on the toolbar), enter a search string and find what I need.

This weekend however, I had to prepare a presentation on IBM WebSphere Service Registry and Repository (great name, isn't it).&nbsp;Since I was going to sit in the library, without any network access (that's how I get boring work done) I needed all my bookmarked pages pre-loaded. So, I opened up the wsrr tag and right-clicked and choose "Open in tabs". Lo and behold, not only did it open my bookmarks, it also closed my already existing 50-or-so tabs. Not so great.

The del.icio.us developers take bug reports and feedback on a Yahoo Group so [I posted my problem there](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/delicious-firefox-extension/message/925). And, a few days later I got [this reply saying](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/delicious-firefox-extension/message/933) that this actually happens due to a [change in a Firefox update](http://blog.codefront.net/2004/09/30/another-call-to-fix-open-in-tabs-in-firefox/). Workaround provided and tested to work as expected. While I certainly don't agree with the default behavior, it's at least nice that you can change it.
