[Dare is ranting on some issues with the HttpWebRequest class in .NET](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/5/3/23422/87859). This is exactly what I've been fighting for the last two days as well.

A good re-usable library for that makes full use of the HTTP protocol would be extremly useful for many projects. Anyone that wants to team up to produce one?
