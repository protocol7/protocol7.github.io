It's now been a long time since I wrote about our cheese choices for the weekend. Here's how it turned out this weekend.

- Sainte-Maure de Touraine - a beatiful goats milk cheese with a heavy ash and mold rind. This is a new favorite which I'm sure will find its way back to our table.
- Taleggio - this is mostly for Eva, it's one of her favorites, not that I don't enjoy it :-)
- Chimay with beer - and this would be my preferred choice. Makes it to the table probably every other week.

All of this was served with a bottle of Jean Leon Magnolia, a spanish white wine which just arrived at Systembolaget.
