Geronimo M5 is, after a much work, [getting ready for release](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.geronimo.devel/17175). The release passes the TCK testing and has [tons of fixes since M4](http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&pid=10220&fixfor=12310168), in fact, they are getting close to a 1.0.
