Pretty sure that I have linked to this before, but it's well worth a second time. [MSDN patterns & practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/Patterns/default.asp) must be the best page on the entire MSDN. A must have for anyone who plans to write any high-quality and reusable code in .NET.
