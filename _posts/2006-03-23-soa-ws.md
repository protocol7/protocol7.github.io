My [colleague Mårten](http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/blog) just [replied](http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/blog/2006/03/23/soadoesnotnecessarilyequalsws/) to Jimmy Nilssons [question regarding whether SOA == WS](http://www.jnsk.se/weblog/posts/SOA-Qs.htm). As Mårten, I think that equation is not necessarily true, possibly not even desirable.

I view services as a well designed (from both a business and technical standpoint) interface to perform a function. This is not bound to a particular technology (such as WS-\*).&nbsp; In fact, I think the whole WS-\* mess in many cases is holding back the possibilities of building a working SOA due to its complexity. I'm certainly a part of the [Loyal WS-Opposition](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/18/WS-Oppo) and prefer to use the strengths of each protocol rather than adding a leaky layer on top. In my world, using HTTP (preferably REST like) and a MOM (like ActiveMQ or WebSphere MQ) will suffice for building a very strong and flexible backbone to enable SOA.

But, the hard part of building a SOA is not the technical details (that's been solved for years), it's finding a appropriate services based on the business requirements. The experience in this area is far less advanced.
