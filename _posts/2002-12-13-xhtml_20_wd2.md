[A new XHTML 2.0 working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20021211/) has been published by W3C. The big change is that linking is removed for now until the XLink controversy is resolved. I hope they are able to make a XLink 1.1 that fits with the needs for XHTML 2.0. We don't need more then one linking mechanism.
