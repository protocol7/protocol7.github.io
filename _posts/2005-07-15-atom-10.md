[Atom 1.0](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/14/Atom-1.0) has been published. Hopefully this means the begining of the end of the RSS mess.

**Update** : my [Atom feed](/atom) should now be valid Atom 1.0. ~~I've extracted the [RNC schema](/lab/atom-10.rnc) from the spec if anyone wants it handy.  
~~

<ins datetime="2005-07-28T23:42:34-02:00"><strong>Update: </strong> Thomas Broyer points out in the comments that the RNC schema is already available on <a href="http://atompub.org/2005/07/11/atom.rnc">atumpub</a></ins>
