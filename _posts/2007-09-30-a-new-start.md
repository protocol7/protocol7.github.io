A week of vacation with the family turned out to be exactly what I needed. Now feeling very relaxed and even the kid has overslept the last couple of mornings.

Tomorrow I start my new job, at [Callista](http://www.callista.se/enterprise/en/index.html). Hopefully, at least that's my reason, I will get to work in more diverse assignments than was possible at the very focused [Zystems](http://www.zystems.se). My almost five years at Zystems has been the most rewarding in my career, so I hope I get to continue working with them. Given the small IT community here in Sweden, that's seems pretty likely.

Anyways, of to new goals.
