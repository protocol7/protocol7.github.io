The [Java Technology Concept Map](http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/new2java/javamap/intro.html) is a overview of most of the "official" Java technologies. Quite a nice picture of what we got and how it's all connected. I wonder if it will be possible to get as a huge printout for the office wall without having to glue up the 18 papers it would take me to print it myself?
