Microsoft has [released](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25983.html) J#.NET, their own Java implementation that creates MSIL. Have to agree with Gartner, the target group for this language got to be pretty small. But, if the get the Java 1.3.1 to .NET converter working, that should be really interesting. I've tried to current beta version with not really satisfactory results.
