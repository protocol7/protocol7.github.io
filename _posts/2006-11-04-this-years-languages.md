Inspired by [Bill de h√≥ra](http://www.dehora.net/journal/2006/11/language_popularity_as_deployed.html) I've tried to list the languages I've used the last year. This list might not be complete so it's pretty likely that I'll append some additional items later as I remember them.

- Java
- MQ script
- Javascript
- C#
- ESQL
- HTML
- JSP
- Velocity
- JACL
- CSS
- SQL
- XSLT
- Relax NG
- XML Schema
- Ant
- Jelly

As Bill, I find it interesting to follow up in a year and see how my behavior developers. This list has probably stayed fairly stable for the last three years or so. This year some of the web stuff (like JS and CSS) made somewhat of a comeback for me. I expect more of that for next year.
