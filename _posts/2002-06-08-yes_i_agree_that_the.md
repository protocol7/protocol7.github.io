Yes, I agree that the [World Cup Game Tracker](http://cbc.ca/sports/afp/wc-flash/2/gametracker.html) is [useful](http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/2002/06/09.html#e000514). But, what's the value of having the application in a format that is hard to index and not accessiable when it could just as well been done with something as simple as HTML? I like Flash, but I think it should be used with caution and only where it's really needed.
