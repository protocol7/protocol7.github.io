The moaning on the crappy (X)HTML that the ASP.NET controls spit out is finally getting [some](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0603b.shtml#dotnyet) [much needed](http://www.splorp.com/blog/archive/2003_06_01_archive.html#105604957243094752) [attention](http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?tabindex=1&PostID=34126).

I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Microsoft to ship better workin controls, they got a lously record when it comes to producing anything that conforms to (X)HTML. Let's start a open source project that aims to deliver this instead. I'm in, any others?
