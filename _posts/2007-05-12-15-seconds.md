On Thursday I was interviewed by a journalist from the Swedish computer magazine [Computer Sweden](http://computersweden.idg.se/). The topic was how it has worked out to take paternity leave as a dad in the IT industry. I was probably a pretty dull subject since I've only experienced the positive sides of staying home.

Today I meet up with a [photographer](http://www.stefanideberg.se) who took some shoots of me and Albin. Hopefully he'll choose one with Albin in focus and me as a blur somewhere in the background. I'm no good on getting this kind of attention.

Update: rumour has it that the article was in the paper today. I haven't seen it so I have no clue as to how stupid I look in the picture or how cute Albin is. Can't seem to find it online and I'm not a subscriber.
