Lazyweb wish: I'm hosting a bunch of blogs on my installation of MT (\>10, might soon be \>50). Most of these share the same templates, so, when I change something in one of the templates I want to rebuild all blogs. Instead of doing this one-by-one I would like a simple "Rebuild all blogs". Anyone got this already or has a good idea to where to start building it?

Thanks for helping out!
