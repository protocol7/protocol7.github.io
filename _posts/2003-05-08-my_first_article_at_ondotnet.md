[My first article on the System.Drawing namespace](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/05/05/gdiplus.html) has been published over at [ONDotnet](http://www.ondotnet.com/). The article is a gentle introduction to GDI+ and some basic System.Drawing classes. The idea is to help a newcomer to get his first drawing code up and running.

I'm very interested in feeback on areas on drawing in .NET that you would like me to cover in future articles.
