[Opera gets back at MSN but releasing a special version of Opera](http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2003/02/14/). What it does? Makes the content of msn.com looks like it was written by thw swedish chef. [Mark has a screenshot.](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/02/14/foock_yuoo_tuu_bork_bork_bork.html) :-D
