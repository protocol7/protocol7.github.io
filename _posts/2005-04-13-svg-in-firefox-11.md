[Mozillazine links](http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6393) to an [article in Publish](http://www.publish.com/article2/0,1759,1784921,00.asp), stating that SVG will be in Firefox 1.1 The discussion at Mozillazine seems to confirm this, and [the bug for enabling SVG is scheduled for 1.8b2](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122092). Finally having SVG, in mixed namespaces, will enable web developers to build sites never seen before.

This, and SVG in Opera, makes for very cool times ahead!
