The rumour was true. [Tipic and Ximian today anoounced that Tipic will use Mono for their Jabber products](http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=tipic_mono). This is quite exciting since both Jabber and .NET is close to my heart. I will sure follow this as closely as possible.
