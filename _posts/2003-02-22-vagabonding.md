"[Vagabonding.com](http://www.vagabonding.com) chronicles the solo, one year, round-the-world journey of Mike Pugh, an optimist from Chicago, USA."

What an amazing site. And even more amazing journey. I wan't to leave snowy Sweden right away and start our planned trip to South america. Hopefully, this autumn we're going.
