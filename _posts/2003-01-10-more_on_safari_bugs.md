[Mark Pilgrim has a pretty long list of bugs in Safari](http://diveintomark.org/safari/ "Safari information for web designers [dive into mark]"). [And David Hyatt continous to answer and fix.](http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/) Wow! Now, if all companies would work this way, it would sure be a lot nicer to be a developer.
