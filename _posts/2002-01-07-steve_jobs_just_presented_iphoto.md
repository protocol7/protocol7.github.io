Steve Jobs just presented IPhoto which seemed pretty lame. A program to keep track of your photos. XPhas that built in already... ACDC has it just as good... naah...

and the new iMac looks like a toy... don't know why anyone would want it other then as a pretty thing in the apartment... I think Apple can do better stuff then this!
