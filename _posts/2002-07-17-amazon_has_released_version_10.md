Amazon has [released](http://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/ntg/browse/-/1067662/103-7205521-5438235) version 1.0 of [their free web services](http://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/resources.html/103-7205521-5438235). This is going to be a new Google with lots of [developers](http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/2002/07/16.html#a307) playing with it. What will be the next big site releasing free web services?

Amazon choose a "please-all" strategy and released both SOAP over HTTP POST and XML over HTTP GET endpoints. It will be interesting to see if there are any differences in the apps built with these two methods.
