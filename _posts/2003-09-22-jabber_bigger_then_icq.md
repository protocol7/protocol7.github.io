[Well, at least according to JSF](http://www.jabber.org/press/2003-09-22.php "JSF :: Press Releases :: 2003-09-22"). I'm not so sure, 6 million users of ICQ sounds like a really low number. Anyways, Jabber is a way better technology compared to ICQ so I hope it's true and that Jabber will containue growing.
