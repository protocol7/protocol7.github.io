[Pete Lacey started a thread](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.services.soa.yahoo-1/6177) on peoples favorite reading material over at the service-orientated-architecture mailing list. Quite a few people has chimed in and the list is getting pretty extensive. [Mike Glendinning's list](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.services.soa.yahoo-1/6226) is in itself impressive. Anyways, I collected the suggested books into an [Amazon wish list](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/KY3718NDSPUV) for easy consumption. Enjoy.

(Having a slow evening by myself, watching [Heroes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_%28TV_series%29), eating a nice piece of [pecorino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecorino_Crotonese) and drinking a bottle of [Oxford Gold](http://www.brakspear-beers.co.uk/brakspear2006_draught.htm). Could be worse.)
