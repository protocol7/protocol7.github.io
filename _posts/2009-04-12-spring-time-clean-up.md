Feeling it was that time of the year when you get the urge for a new site look. Of course, not that anyone actually visits sites anymore. But still. Seeing [Jonas Bon√©r site](http://jonasboner.com/), I wanted that theme so bad. Turns out it's based on the default [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master) theme and Jonas was happy to let me steal the look. So, I've now adopted it as a Wordpress theme. Right now, it's pretty much a straight copy of Jonas look, but I wanted to have a baseline to start from. Over time, it will likely diverge somewhat from the current look. Also, I will publish the sources in the coming days on [my GitHub page](http://github.com/protocol7/).

Update: I've now [published the theme](http://github.com/protocol7/wp-jekyll-theme/tree/master) on my github. Since Jekyll is under a MIT license, I picked the same license for this theme.
