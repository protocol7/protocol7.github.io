Google Research has [collected full six DVDs of words](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html) from their internet index. That's 1,011,582,453,213 unique words, with counts. Amazing material if you're in to that stuff. I have no idea what to do with the data, but I'm thinking of ordering it just to play around with.
