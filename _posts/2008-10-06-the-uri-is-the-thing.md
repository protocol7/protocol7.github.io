If you liked his previous poster, [The Web Is An Agreement](http://thewebisagreement.com/), you're going to love [this one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/2918889380/). I think [psd](http://blog.whatfettle.com/) has outdone himself. Find myself searching for new small details all the time.

Now it's time to convince [The Wife](http://protocol7.com/hysteria) that this needs to go on a wall somewhere...
