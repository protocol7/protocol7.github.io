[News](http://news.com.com/2100-1001-961313.html) are spreading on [MS "XDocs"](http://www.microsoft.com/office/xdocs/default.asp). XDocs is the app that claims to make it easy to connect your server providing XML data and Office for editing. Could be really powerful if they do it right. Of course, the best would be a cross-browser way of doing this. But since the support for XML Schema or even XML in the big browsers are... uh.. somewhat lacking, and the DOM methods for doing standardized validation are still a [working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Val-20021008/), I wouldn't expect this anytime soon.

Sidenote: Since MS is switching to XML based formats for Office, it's going to be really interesting to see what format they choose for WordArt. VML? SVG? Something else?
