[The new version of webMathematica now supports SVG and MathML output](http://www.wolfram.com/products/webmathematica/newfeatures.html). It sure looks like SVG is making progress at being **the** vector graphics format. However, in the interactive vector graphics market Flash is still way ahead in terms of usage and number of developers. Slowly that might hopefully change.
