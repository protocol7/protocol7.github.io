[Tim Bray on the XML support in Office 11](http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200210/msg01357.html). From his early tests I have to say it looks a bit disappointing. A few issues:

- The could have used XHTMLto support most of the current formating. And them added their extensions. They don't. They instead use something very different and ridiculously verbose
- They could have used SVG to describe WordArt. They still use VML

Oh well, a XML based format is better then a binary at least...
