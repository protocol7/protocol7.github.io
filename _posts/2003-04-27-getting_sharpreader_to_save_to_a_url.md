[Luke today noticed that you can open an OPML file from an URL in SharpReader](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/27.html#000076). While this is great, what would be even better is if we could have the OPML file placed on a web server and Sharpreader would read and write to it (via FTP, WebDAV, a web service or what ever). I'm using SharpReader on several computers and it's sure no fun trying to keep my subscription lists in sync.

Please? :-)
