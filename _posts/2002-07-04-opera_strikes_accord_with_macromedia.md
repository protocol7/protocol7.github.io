[Opera strikes accord with Macromedia](http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2002/07/20020702.html). Even if I don't agree that Opera is "the most standards-compliant Web browser" or that Macromedia is "committed to open solutions that are built to fully support existing Web standards", it's nice that the other browsers are seriously starting to get some real support.
