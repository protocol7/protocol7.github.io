I just uploaded a new [script](http://www.protocol7.com/default.asp?x=projdoc/p7_getMSXMLVersion) that will detect what version of MSXML a client has installed. It's a more powerful and smaller version of the script you can find [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/02/web/web0202.asp).
