The news on [Flash MX](http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/productinfo/features/)is out and it looks pretty damn impressive again. New features:

- better arranged IDE
- they seems to have made some work on the actionscript editor as well, that was needed.
- debugger with breakpoints
- embedded video
- the event handling is improved, this is probably the best of all the new features.
- setInterval()
- textfields and buttons are now finally objects
- shape drawing. John Dowell talked a little bit on this on the SVG developers list. Will make it possible to make Flash show SVG, at least Tiny or Basic.
- sound completion event
- can now load MP3 and jpegs from external sources
- Unicode support
- Anchors, makes the back and forward buttons in the browser usable in Flash

But, still the old binary file format... they don't seem the get XML for real.
