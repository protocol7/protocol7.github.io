An [AMQP](http://www.twiststandards.org/tiki-index.php?page=AMQ) implementation project has been proposed to Apache Incubator in the form of the [Blaze project](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/Blaze). As I belive that AMQP can become a very important piece for interoperability and commodization of messaging, I think this would be an excellent addition to Apache. I'm pretty confident that a strong community could form around it as many players should be interested. Even some of the major players (read IBM) might be encouraged by an Apache project being the foundation for AMQP.

If this stuff interests you, speak up on the [Incubator mailing list](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/)
