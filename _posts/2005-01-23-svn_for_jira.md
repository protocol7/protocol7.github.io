[From the Geronimo mailing list](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.geronimo.devel/10574), Atlassian has developed a [Subversion plugin for JIRA](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAEXT/JIRA+Subversion+plugin). Since we're heavy JIRA users at work, this might be very interesting if we decide to make the move to SVN.
