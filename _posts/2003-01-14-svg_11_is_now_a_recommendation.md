[SVG 1.1 and SVG Mobile are now W3C Recommendations](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/). SVG 1.1 is the modularization of SVG 1.0. SVG Mobile (Tiny and Basic) are subsets of SVG 1.1 for mobile devices.

[Read more in the FAQ](http://www.w3.org/2003/01/svg11-faq) and [testimonials](http://www.w3.org/2003/01/svg11-testimonial)

It's great that they are now recommendations so that the working group can turn to more interesting specs, especially [SVG 1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG12/) that will see huge updates to the text handling.
