Three week ago today, the most beatiful boy of all was born, Albin RÃ¥berg :-) ![Albin looker real clever]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/73313511_f22f5e22dc.jpg) Today, some 20 days later we are still slowly adapting to being parents. Making food, washing all clothes with pee/puke/crap and managing all friends and family that wants to visit is hard work. But a having him sit in the ones lap and smile happily (at least that's what we would like to think that he is doing) makes it all worth-while. And it takes a hungry, crying baby to realize the number of reruns of 80-ties shows the run on the middle of the night (A-team, still the best).
