Against my own better judgement I'm trying out [Twitter](http://twitter.com/protocol7). After a day, I'm far from convinced that it's of any use. If you know me and are using Twitter, feel free to add me as a friend, maybe that will make it more interesting.

Well, at least they gave me a cute looking error screen.
