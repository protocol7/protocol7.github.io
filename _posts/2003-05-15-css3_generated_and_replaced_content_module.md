W3C today release the first working draft of [CSS3 Generated and Replaced Content Module](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/). It's the bigger brother of ::before(content:x;). From the first read it looks pretty powerful but maybe a bit complex. Anyway, I would love to be able to use headers and footers in some future browser. Will XHTML+CSS some day make XSL-FO oblivious?
