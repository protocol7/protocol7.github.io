Jonathan Watt has written up some [authoring guidelines for SVG](http://jwatt.org/svg/authoring/). All SVG authors should read and obey these rules.

I hope someone gets around to writing a SVG validator that besides doing the regular validation also warns for common interoperability problems. Possibly based on [Relaxed](http://badame.vse.cz/validator/) (Relax-NG + Schematron). Such a tool would greatly help authors to write SVG files that works in all viewers.
