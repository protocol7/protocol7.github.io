Macromedia also released [Flash Communication Server](http://www.macromedia.com/desdev/mx/flashcom/) today. With the server you can build real-time video sharing apps and lots more. Very cool stuff and it opens up a world of new kinds of applications that we haven't seen on the net before. Now, if they only could switch to a open, accessiable format...
