I finally found the time to publish [my presentation from SDC2009](http://www.slideshare.net/protocol7/rest-made-simple-with-java). The topic is REST basics in general and JAX-RS in particular. As many of my presentations, the slides are not that very rich on words. I like having keywords on the slide which I can talk around, rather than the full manuscript. Thus, the slides might not be that very useful on their own, but even so, I wanted to post them. I will also clean up and publish the demo application I refer to in the slides. I'll post an update when it's done.

SDC2009 was a nice conference, but not having plenty of power cords and free wifi feels a bit old by now. My favorite talk was [Jonas Bon√©r](http://jonasboner.com/) on [JVM concurrency](http://jonasboner.com/talks/state_youre_doing_it_wrong/html/all.html). Jonas is extremely knowledgeable on the topic and gave me some new insights.
