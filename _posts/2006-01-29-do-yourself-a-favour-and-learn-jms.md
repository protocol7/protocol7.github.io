[This post on why many Java developers are ignorant of JMS](http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t62690.html) makes a lot of sense to me. "Getting" messaging sure was an eye-opener, or a [Lidnersk kn√§pp](http://susning.nu/Lidnersk_kn%E4pp) as we would call it in swedish. So, do yourself a favour and make "understand messaging" your late new years resolution (you probably broke the other ones already). After you do, the number of issues your applications get due to network and scalability problems will diminish.
