Sam Ruby's [recent](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/12/28/Unobtrusive-OpenID) [interest](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers) [in](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.openid.general/3641) [OpenID](http://openid.net/) might be the best thing that could happen. With the size of his audience (2234 subscribers on Bloglines only), his deep understanding of how to spread stuff like this and his desire to hack it is bound to make OpenID take a well deserved jump forward in awareness.
