The work has begun on the standard that shouldn't exist. The last couple of years work on XML has shown that a new revision is necessary. [Tim Bray and some others](http://www.textuality.com/xml/xmlSW.html) has written a skinkworks document outlining their ideas for XML 2.0. They throw out DTD, entities and add namespaces, base and infoset.

I think this a necessary step to take. XML makes no sense without namespaces so it should be better integrated. And DTDs and entities has past their best-before date.

[xml.com](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/02/20/deviant.html) has a very interesting article about this as well.
