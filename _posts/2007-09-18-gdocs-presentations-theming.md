As widely reported, [Google today launched](http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2007/09/and-now-we-present.html) their PowerPoint/Impress equivalent over at [GDocs](http://documents.google.com/). I'm a happy user of GDocs, so this is something I'm quite interested in. Not that I'm creating that many presentations, but when I do, this could be a useful tool.

One thing, that I find odd that they don't seem to have implemented, is a way of creating your own themes. Conventional wisdom seems to say that presentations should be heavily sprinkled with your company logos (although some that actually knows this stuff [seems to disagree](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/05/the_source_of_a.html)). Not being able to create your own theme would put a lot of users of. Of course, Google offers some pre-defined themes, much like the useless templates you will find on Powerpoint or Impress. And, if you import a PPT file, it will actually use the theme from the PPT as the theme in GDocs, however, there seems to be no way of editing or reusing it. Odd.
