One of my few personal heros, Stephen Jay Gould [died](http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=search&StoryID=985184) of cancer today aged 60. Gould is most famous for his books, such as "The Panda's Thumb" (I've read it probably five times) but I got most from reading his many scientific articles.  
This is a sad day.
