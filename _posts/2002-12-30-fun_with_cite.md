Mark Pilgrim has been having a lot of fun [using the cite element in HTML](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope) to automatically produce a [citation index for his blog](http://diveintomark.org/archives/citations/) (he also [posted a follow up with some comments](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/29.html)). Pretty clever as usual. And, as we're all used to by now this of couse started a huge discussion on sementics and HTML.
