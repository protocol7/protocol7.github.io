[Opera has redesigned their entire HTML engine](http://rss.com.com/2100-1023-954561.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) (also at [WaSP](http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2002_08.html#a000075)). This is hopefully good news, finally they will be able to provide us with a fully conformant browser.
