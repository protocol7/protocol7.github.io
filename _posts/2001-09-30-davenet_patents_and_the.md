[DaveNet : Patents and the W3C](http://davenet.userland.com/2001/09/30/patentsAndTheW3c) and [OpenPhD: W3C\_Patent\_Policy](http://www.openphd.net/W3C_Patent_Policy/) - W3C is thinking about ways to allow it's members (such as adobe, apple, microsoft, ibm and so on) to patent the work they do. This might be something bad (having to pay to use the standards) or good (companies protect their work while still being able to contribute to free webstandards... which ever way it will turn it will for sure bet different... give your feedback on it to w3c.
