The SharpVectorGraphics project, which is hacking on a SVG viewer for .NET, will make it's first public release (version 0.2) in a few days. So far, [we pass 49 of the test cases](http://www.protocol7.com/svg.net/tests.asp) in the [SVG 1.0 Test Suite](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test) (we passed 20 with version 0.1). That's really good progress if you ask me :-)

More news as soon as we release the files.
