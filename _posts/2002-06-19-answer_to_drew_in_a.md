[Answer to Drew](http://radio.weblogs.com/0104813/2002/06/18.html#a65), in a future verison it should certainly support the subset of SMIL that is part of SVG 1.0. For support for other SMIL elements, I guess we'll just to wait and see if someone will be interested in joining the project and add that :-)
