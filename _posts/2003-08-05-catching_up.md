Been away on vacation for some time, here's my attempt to catch up with events:

- [Xerces 2.5.0 released](http://jakarta.apache.org/site/elsewhere.html#20030731.1). New stuff is DOM3, Load/Save and a partial XInclude implementation
- Netscape screwed. [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) born. Can't decide if this is good or bad news for Mozilla.
- [Mozilla 1.5a released](http://mozilla.org/releases/#1.5a). Not based on Firebird, no surprise.
- [New working draft for SVG 1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-SVG12-20030715/). I'll post my thoughts on that later.
- Sounds like [SVG Open](http://www.svgopen.org/) was success this year too
- [Final name vote](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/NameFinalVote) is up for Pie/Echo/Necho/Atom.
- Eric Meyer (formally at Netscape) [is working with Macromedia on some CSS projects](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2003c.html#t20030801). Maybe the CSS rumours surrounding Flash Player 7 is true
