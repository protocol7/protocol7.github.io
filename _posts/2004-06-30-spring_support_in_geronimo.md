[James Strachan](http://radio.weblogs.com/0112098/) has [hacked up support for Spring in Geronimo](http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/000246.html). When ready it will enable including a Spring deployment descriptor in your EAR and it will run in the application server. This is excellent news and a very cool feature while waiting for EJB3.

And the same thing is [happing](http://www.codehaus.org/~jboynes/) for Hibernate.
