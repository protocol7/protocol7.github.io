The [SVG 1.1 implementation status page](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20021115/matrix.html) has an interesting little note: " Note: interact-cursor-01-f was tested with Adobe ASV4 (unreleased), not ASV3". I think that's the first sign that Adobe is actually activly working on ASV4. Nice!

Also, cool to see that Nokia go an almost full SVG Tiny implementation. I wonder when we got that in our phones.

It's interesting to see so many SVG implementations already. Lots of companies backing SVG. Now, let's see who nails all tests first. My bet is on Batik but you never know.
