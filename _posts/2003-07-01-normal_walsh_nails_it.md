On Echo:

> "But I am astonished by the debate over escaped HTML. Most of the phrases that spring immediately to mind when I consider this debate are unprintable. At least, I'm not going to print them. Not in public. Here's a sanitized summary: 'are you freaking nuts?'"

From [Normal Walsh weblog](http://norman.walsh.name/2003/06/30/hardline "Taking a Hard Line").

I agree with everything he says. We now have XML, why do we want to build tagsoup support into brand new specs. XHTML is an excellent format and there is [absolutely brilliant applications](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/) for automatically converting your legacy content to wellformed and valid XHTML. Can we please move on.
