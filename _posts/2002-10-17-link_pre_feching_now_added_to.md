[Link pre-feching](http://www.deftone.com/blogzilla/archives/mozilla_getting_faster.html), now added to Mozilla, allowes page authors to specify stuff that the browser should download to it's cache before even going there. This will be very powerful for speeding up sites. And allows us to do something done with crappy hacks (hidden frames, scripts) in a much better way. Way to go Mozilla (again)!
