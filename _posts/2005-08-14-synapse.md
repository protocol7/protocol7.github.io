A new project, [Synapse](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/SynapseProposal), has been proposed for Apache incubation. The project aims to build an ESB/broker that will complement the Apache WS stack. The main initiators of the proposal are some of the Apache WS heavyweights like [Dims](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/dims/archives/003328.html). While I still need some convincing of whether "the principles of service oriented architectures" is the final solution to integration, the proposal is interesting. If the project is successful (and I have no doubts it will) it will be a strong contender in the quickly evolving ESB/BPM/JBI space. It sure will be interesting to see how it will stand up against the giants, primarily [IBM's WBI](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/info1/websphere/index.jsp?tab=products/businessint) and [BEA's AquaLogic](http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=index.htm&FP=/content/products/aqualogic/). History has shown that open-source software can be very successful in the middleware space. Since that has made app servers commondity, this area has lately attracted a lot of interest from the vendors as a way of building added value on their existing infrastructure. One can not help but wondering how long that will last.

I must say that I'm a but surprised that the [ServiceMix](http://servicemix.org/) people doesn't seem to be involved in this. It does seem to fit them like a glove, maybe some more people-level integration is needed?
