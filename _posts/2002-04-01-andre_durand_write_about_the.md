Andre Durand [write](http://discuss.andredurand.com/stories/storyReader$276) about the future development of Jabber. He thinks better, fewer and more extensiable (from server side) clients are the way to go. I very much agree. I think this is crucial for Jabber to ever reach beyond the geeks. But sadly, most of the client developers don't really understand this. We tried to with [webjab](http://www.webjab.com) (now pretty much dead), and I think we got a bit on the way but much much more is needed.

Then, the other way I see Jabber being used is as a hidden tool to send small XML messages across the web. This is where Jabber might be really important in todays distributed computer world.
