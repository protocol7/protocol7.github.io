Dave has also [read](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/01#la1ae9c78efd7c51d5a320ca81b3507c9) the news.com article. Just two comments:  
1. They do let the chief architecht of Flash respond, he's a Flash user for sure :-)  
2. I would claim that Macromedia is not really inventing with Flash any more. They sure did, but now I think they are mostly patching a broken solution. Let's restart the revolution that Flash once were, and let's do it right from the begining this time.
