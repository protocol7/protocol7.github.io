[Eclipse 3.1 has been released.](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=34870) Eclipse servers are probably smoking by now, the site is hardly accessable (BitTorrent anyone?).

I've been using every milestone since 3.0 and very much like what I've seen in 3.1. Since I don't use J2S... sorry Java Platform SE 5.0 yet, I don't care much about generics and friends. I do like the small things, like performance improvments, quick-filtering of the tree in Preferences, and the new CVS commit dialog.
