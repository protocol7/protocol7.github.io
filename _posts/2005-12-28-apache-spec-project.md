[Some Apache commiters are investigating](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200512.mbox/browser) how to set up a common project (possibly within Jakarta or as a top-level project) for specifications. Several projects (e.g. Tomcat, WS-\*) uses these frequently and with Geronimo the numbers exploded. As they are used in multiple projects, having a common project makes a lot of sense.

I think this can be the start of an important project for Java developers as we will be getting access to high-quality, clean room and ASL licensed implementations of the specs, not only from JCP but also from OMG, W3C and the WS orgs.
