One small bump that someone had modified slightly since my last visit, and this is the result. [![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/506495725_d5e3303f50_m.jpg)](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/506495725_d5e3303f50_b.jpg)The knee isn't looking very good either, but the picture of it doesn't really make it justice.

In addition, it's great planning to perform a dive the day before I'm taking Albin to day care for the first time :-)

Anyways, Copenhagen was great. Expect a more detailed report soon.
