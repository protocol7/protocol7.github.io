Andrew Black [reports](http://www.tribalonline.f2s.com/v3/flash/regexp/) on creating RegExp functionality in Flash. That's amazing! I've been thinking about doing this for a long time but never came around to really do it. And this implementation seems much better (maybe a little bit slow so far) then I would ever been able to do. I will follow his improvments.
