DeveloperWorks has a [new article](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-sxbl1/index.html?ca=drs-tp0405) from Elliot Rusty Harold on sXBL, the SVG XML Binding Language. While I don't agree with the SVG WG to focus on building an application framework for the web (I think there's enough for them to do on specifying the perfect vector graphics language first) I think it's great that XBL is finally being standardised. I don't expect much to happen with sXBL (too SVG specific), but I think that exciting things might occur when XBL 2.0 is published. If ever implemented in browsers it will be very powerful for web developers.
