Business Week has a lengthy article on Linux, described from the standpoint of being a somewhat unusual "corporation". Its an interesting read and shows how great the industry move behind Linux really is.

Early last year I made a promise to switch to Linux on my laptop before the end of the year, unfortunately this did turn out true as some of the tools I use daily at work, most notably some editions of WSAD, does not work on Linux. However, this looks like it will change soon so I'll extends my promise to the end of 2005. Before then I will run Linux on my laptop as well as on my other personal computers (this is already done). The reason? I simply like the platform better, the command line interface that can do anything (no more RDP), apt-get/yum installations and the openness are the main driving factors.
