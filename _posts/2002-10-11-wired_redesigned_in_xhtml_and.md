[Wired](http://www.wired.com/) redesigned in XHTML and CSS. They even got [an article on the rationale behind it](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,55675,00.html).  
It's cool to finally see the big sites doing what many developers have talked about for some time now. Way to go! Who will be next?
