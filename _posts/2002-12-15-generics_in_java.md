[Java is getting support for generics.](http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/generics/) As far as I can tell the syntax is exactly the same as in C#. That's good. Lately I've been doing lots of both Java and C# development and would love to see generics added to both worlds.
