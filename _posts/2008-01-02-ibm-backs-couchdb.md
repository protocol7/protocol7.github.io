Damien Katz is [going to IBM](http://damienkatz.net/2008/01/new_gig.html) to work full time on [CouchDB](http://www.couchdb.org). All arranged by [Sam Ruby](http://intertwingly.net/blog/) and friends. This is excellent news for the CouchDB community. Besides having Damien being focused on the project, getting IBMs deep knowledge on storage systems, both from DB2 and Domino/Notes I'm sure will be very beneficial.

And on top of all that, the code is moving to Apache and will be relicensed under ASL2. Still [no open discussions](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200801.mbox/browser) in [Apache Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/), but I'm guessing that's where it's heading. Having CouchDB at Apache will be great! And I like that Apache is getting into more alternative technologies besides the comfort zone of C and Java.

CouchDB is getting more and more interesting to watch by the day.

Update: links was lost in publishing somehow.
