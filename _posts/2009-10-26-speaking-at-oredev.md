Next week, I'll be presenting at [Øredev in Malmö](http://www.oredev.org/). [My session](http://www.oredev.org/prod/oredev/site.nsf/docsbycodename/session?opendocument&sid=74973266B956E2E7C1257593006F5518&day=4&track=E92AC6A14535633BC12575A5004943A0) will be on the strengths and weaknesses of JAX-RS. So, if you happen to be in Malmö, feel free to come by and say hi. I'll be sharing the presentation and the accompanying code here after the talk. I also understand there will be videos of all talks available so if you like to see me stuttering, have a look at the conference site afterward.

Unfortunately, it seems like work will only allow me for visiting the conference over day. Given the quality of speakers, this is utter failure, but what do you do.
