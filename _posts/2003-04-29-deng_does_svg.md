DENG, the XML/CSS rendering ening built in Flash, can now render [some simple SVG samples](http://claus.packts.net/w3blog/index.php?id=57). Pretty exciting what you can do with XML as soon as you got the basics (like CSS) working. I hope they continue of the renderer and see how far they can take it.
