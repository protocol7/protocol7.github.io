[Tim Bray on JCP](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/11/24/What-Sun-Should-Do)

> In 2008, the JCP is costing Sun opportunities and friends and gaining us very little that I can see.
> 
> So Id like Sun to set the JCP free, turn it over to the community, and when we develop some cool Java-based technology in-house, take it to market, try to make some money with it, and after its caught on and the bugs are shaken out, consider whether or not it ought to be taken to the JCP.

Amen.
