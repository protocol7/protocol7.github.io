I haven't blogged anything on the progress of the .NET-based SVG viewer for a while. So, I guess it's teaser time :-)

Here are some screens of the latest build showing some of the new stuff:

- [text support](http://www.protocol7.com/svg.net/screens/text.gif)
- [...with external references](http://www.protocol7.com/svg.net/screens/extTRef.gif)
- [gradients](http://www.protocol7.com/svg.net/screens/gradient.gif)

Lots of the basic stuff has been added as well, e.g. bounding box calculation, xml:base support and much more. And, of course, lots of bug fixes.
