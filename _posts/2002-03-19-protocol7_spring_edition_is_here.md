 **protocol7 spring edition** is here. A little cleaner, a little more clever and much better looking. Hope you like it. And, if you don't you can find a style switcher (thanks to [Paul](http://idontsmoke.co.uk)) in the lower right corner.

It might be worth noting that the two different styles uses the exact same markup and only differ in what CSS stylesheet they use. That's the power of CSS.
