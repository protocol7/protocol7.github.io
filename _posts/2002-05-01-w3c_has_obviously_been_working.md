W3C has obviously been working hard. Today they released a bunch of new documents:

- [SVG 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-SVG11-20020430/) and [Mobile](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-SVGMobile-20020430/)
- [XHTML + MathML + SVG profile](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-XHTMLplusMathMLplusSVG-20020430) - this is really exciting, mixing SVG with XHTML is the future of the web in my dreams.
- [XSLT 2.0 WD](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xslt20-20020430)
- [XPath 2.0 WD](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xpath20-20020430)
- [XQuery 1.0 WD](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-20020430)
- [Amaya 6.1](http://www.w3.org/Amaya/)

and even [more...](http://www.w3.org) all of this is amazing! Keep up the good work.
