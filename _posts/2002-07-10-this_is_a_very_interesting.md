This is a very interesting [demo of XLink support](http://www.snee.com/xml/xlink/sxlinkdemo.xml) in Mozilla. I find it important that Mozilla is experimenting with the "new" web standards (e.g. XLink, XForms, SVG) to set and example for other browsers. IE is no longer the most feature-rich browser.
