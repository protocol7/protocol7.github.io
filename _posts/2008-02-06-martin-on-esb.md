On of my former colleagues, Martin Rydman, has [started blogging](http://mrbaseline.wordpress.com/). In one of his first posts, he takes a look at Jim Webber's [debunking of ESBs](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/webber-guerilla-soa). Martin is a really clever guy and responsible for the Baseline concept (or should that be "methodology"?) so his blog will be interesting to follow. But the most interesting trend here is that Zystems [wants to be more open](http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/blog/2008/02/06/mr-baseline-got-himself-a-blog/) and active in the community. I most certainly applaud that. Let's get the discussions flowing.
