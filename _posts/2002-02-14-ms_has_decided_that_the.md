MS has [decided](http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0202b&L=dotnet&F=&S=&P=79795) that the won't trust .exe applications running in the browser sandbox in .Net. This is the same way as Java applets has been working for many years. While it's good from a security point of view, it's a huge disadvantge for people like me who where longing for a good (java applets are not good enough) way to automatically run apps (plugins) in users browsers...
