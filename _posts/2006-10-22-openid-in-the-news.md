Some exciting&nbsp;news on [OpenID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID) adoption the last couple of days (for me anyways). First of, [Technorati is now supporting OpenID](http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/10/144.html) for claiming your blog with more stuff coming soon. The [Techcrunch article about Technorati](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/19/technorati-announces-support-for-open-id/) also mentions that the big players are participating in discussions on OpenID. I think it would make perfect sense for someone like Google or Yahoo do like [Verisign](http://pip.verisignlabs.com/) and start providing OpenID identies to their already existing users.

The Technorati page contained a link to a new [OpenID plugin for Wordpress](http://blog.verselogic.net/projects/wordpress/wordpress-openid-plugin/). This one is way more clever than [the one I previously used](http://protocol7.com/archives/2006/08/21/openid-on-protocol7/) and requires no theme hackery what so ever (just install and you'r done). So, I reverted my hacked theme back to square one and installed the plugin. All done and OpenID authentication is working like a charm. At least that's what my tests show, feel free to give me feedback on any troubles or improvements!

Last but not least, [Normal Walsh seems to like OpenID as well](http://norman.walsh.name/2006/10/20/identity). I'll leave with his final words that perfectly well reflects my sentiments.

> Next time you build a web application that needs a login, consider OpenID.
