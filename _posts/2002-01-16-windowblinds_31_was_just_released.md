[WindowBlinds 3.1](http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail.php3?fid=947721727) was just released. I'm running it now. It's way faster then older versions. I wonder if it's the hardware acceleration that makes the difference. And what kind of hardware acceleration is it? Will I be bying a WindowBlind-AGP card soon? :-)
