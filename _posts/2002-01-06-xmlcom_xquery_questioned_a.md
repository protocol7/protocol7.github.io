[XML.com: XQuery Questioned](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/01/02/xquery.html) - a very nice summary of the discussion in xml-dev lately. In the end it seemed like most people understood the arguments made by the XQuery WG people. Have to say it's sad that a standard gets accepted based on:  
1. Some people (or companies) are very protective about a strange format  
2. Lack of time
