[Drew](http://radio.weblogs.com/0104813/2002/06/17.html#a62) is wondering what the SVG.NET Viewer is, and he's right. The aim is to use the SharpVectorGraphics project (creating the SVG DOM in C#) to produce a SVG viewer written in C#. It will also come with a GDI+ renderer. The first major goal is to produce a static renderer and then hopefully hock up JScript to it to add interactivity.

More info when I get the time :-)
