Claus Wahlers got [a short but interesting article on Deng](http://webaccess.mozquito.com/madrettor/deng.html), the XML/CSS/XHTML/XForms/XFrames rendering engine for Flash. It's an interesting idea, it will be intriguing to see how far they will be able to push it and it sure looks promising so far.
