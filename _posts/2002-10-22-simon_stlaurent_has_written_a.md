Simon St.Laurent has written a draft for IETF on a [The xpath1() scheme](http://simonstl.com/ietf/draft-stlaurent-xpath-frag-00.html) for XPointer. I can't understand why W3C haven't published anything like this already. Anyways, it's good stuff. I'll look into making a .NET implementation of it as soon as I have released the CSS parser and DOM I'm working on at the moment.
