builder.com got an introduction to User Interface Process Application Block (UIPAB). You just have to love that acronym :-)

UIPAB is Microsoft's take on how to build WinForms applications using the MVC pattern. Haven't tried the actually code but you would probably be interested if you're building advanced WinForms applications.
