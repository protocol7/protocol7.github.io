McNealy doesn't seem to be [happy](http://www.oetrends.com/cgi-bin/page_display.cgi?77) with anything. I don't think I can stand behind his logic why open-source is the reason for people moving to .NET (opne-source -\> lower incomes for Sun -\> Microsoft winning the advertising war) [via [Sam Ruby](http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679)]
