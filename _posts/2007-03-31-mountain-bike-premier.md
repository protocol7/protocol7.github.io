This Sunday was the my premier of this years mountain bike season. Spring has been early and strong this year so we spent an hour and a half at Änggården in bright sun and 16 Celsius. I'm still suffering the remains of a cold so I wasn't feeling to well, but still it was very nice to get started.

I'm hoping to be able to participate in two races this year, the first is [Mörksuggejakten](http://www.morksuggejakten.com/), 70 km of rumored beautiful terrain around Rättvik. The second is to significantly beat last years result on [Bockstensturen](http://www.bockstensturen.nu/), the 100 km race outside Varberg. To meet the latter goal, I need to spend more time practicing hill climbing as it's a [fairly hilly track](http://www.bockstensturen.nu/karta.asp). I think I'm going to try some more light-weight tires this year. Could make a great difference.
