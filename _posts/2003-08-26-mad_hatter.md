Sun [is showing of some screen shots of their upcoming desktop, called Mad Hatter](http://www.sun.com/2003-0805/feature/#findoutmore "Mad Hatter screenshots"). That is one ugly skin! Come on Sun, is that really the best you can do? With [Aero](http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/longhorn_aero.asp) and [Aqua](http://www.apple.com/macosx/technologies/aqua.html) around you smell of a mid-90's system.
