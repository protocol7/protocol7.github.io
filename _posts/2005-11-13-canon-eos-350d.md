Today I brought our new camera, a Canon EOS 350D, out for the first time. I got based on recommendation from [Gadde](http://blog.nomethod.net), my personal camera guru.

So far I'm very happy with the experience. It takes nice pictures, is fairly light to carry around and really simple for newbies like myself. And, it doesn't require any special drivers to sync with my computer.

We took a short around a lake close to here, in a nature reserve Sandsj√∂backa. Since Eva is two weeks from the expected birth date she's a little bit immobile but it was nice to get outside in the beatiful autumn. [I uploaded some of the pictures on flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/protocol7/tags/sandsj%C3%B6backa/) for the rest of you to enjoy :-)
