Sometimes it's interesting just to watch the obvious differences between competing products:

The [EJB3 feature pack for WAS](https://www14.software.ibm.com/iwm/web/cc/earlyprograms/websphere/was61ejb3/): 767 Mb  
The [entire Geronimo installation](http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GMOxDEV/Installed+size+comparison+%281.1.1%2C+1.2%2C+2.0%29): 75 Mb
