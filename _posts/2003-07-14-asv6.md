[Adobe has announced a technical preview of their upcoming SVG viewer, called ASV6](http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/beta.html). Lots of new things including support for almost all of SVG 1.2. It's very exciting to see Adobe back in the game.

I've been playing some with the viewer that shipped with the new Adobe reader so I've tried some of the new stuff, but now when it's official I'll try out as much as I can. Expect to see more on this soon.
