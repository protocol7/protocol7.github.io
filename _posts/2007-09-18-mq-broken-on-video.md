The session at Defcon where Martyn Ruks describes his findings about WebSphere MQ security is [now online at Google Video](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-8419995190349463473). I've [previously covered the presentation](http://protocol7.com/archives/2007/07/24/defcon-mq-sequrity-session/), but it's way more interesting to hear the presentation in addition to the published slides. Thanks to the [anon commenter](http://protocol7.com/archives/2007/07/24/defcon-mq-sequrity-session/#comment-46157) who pointed me to the video.
