Today, we had a house call from [the major news show](http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=30624&lid=Rapport) at the national Swedish television. They're making a segment on [kiva.org](http://kiva.org/) and wanted to interview us on why we choose to use it. The reporter found us from [me](http://www.protocol7.com/archives/2007/02/18/kiva/) and [Eva blogging](http://protocol7.com/eva/?p=497) when first starting to use the site. Luckily, I managed to almost completely escape to camera, Eva took the biggest hit.

The topics of the questions focused on how we found Kiva and why one would choose Kiva over a more traditional poverty fighting organization. The also interviewed another guy in Stockholm, should be interesting to watch.

~~Should air on the news tomorrow, it will be interesting how their story ends up and how Eva looks on TV :-). The segment should appear online, I'll add a link when it does.~~ Okay, it aired today and is [up on the web](http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?a=867738). Based on Eva's face I really wonder what is on that screen :-)
