I used uploaded the last parts of the CSS support for SharpVectorGraphics. It's based on a subclassed XmlDocument which adds support for looking up style rules from external stylesheets, style elements, user and useragent stylesheets. It supports the [cascade rules of CSS 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#inheritance), most of the [selectors in CSS 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/) and the [majority of the CSS 2.1 DOM](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/). There are lots of things to improve but it got all the basics. No package yet so you have to get it from the [CVS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/svgdomcsharp). Hopefully there will be a package in a few days to play with. Feel free to [email me any feedback, bug reports or feature requests](mailto:niklas@protocol7.com) :-)
