Stephen Wolfram, of Matematica fame, is about to release his much anticipated book, entitled [_A New Kind of Science_](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.06/wolfram_pr.html). He tries to prove that most research could simply be replaced by matematical modelling. Might be an interesting read, he's a fascinating personality.
