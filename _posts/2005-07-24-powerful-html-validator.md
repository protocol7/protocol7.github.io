[Jirka Kosek today announced](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.text.xml.devel/29605) [Relaxed](http://badame.vse.cz/validator/), a new HTML/XHTML/WCAG validator based on RelaxNG and Schematron. I've been testing it on some sites (including protocol7) and it catches far more issues than the existing W3C validator (using DTDs).

Hopefully this is only the begining of Relaxed, it would be great to find this somewhere where everyone (read: web developers) will find it and to get a bigger group to further define the ruleset used on the validator. Great work [Petr](http://nalevka.com/) and Jirka!
