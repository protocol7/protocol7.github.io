[Phil Scott is thinking about writing a wrapper around both IE and Mozilla.](http://weblogs.asp.net/pscott/ "Phil Scott's WebLog") Please do! It's a great idea and it would be wonderful if we could easily choose between our favorite browser in all programs that embed browsers (like SharpVectors, SharpMT and RssBandit).
