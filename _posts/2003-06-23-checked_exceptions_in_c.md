[Dare misses checked exceptions in C#](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/6/20/183159/456). This is the thing I miss most from Java when doing C# work. [And juding from the chat on the future directions of C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats/vstudio/vstudio_032103.asp), this won't be in the language for a long time, if ever. Too bad really.
