Just had to try out the new blog feature in Word 2007. So far it looks good, although I'm still really confused about the new menu interface. Couldn't even find the Open menu option until after clicking on all menu options at least twice I realized that the little circle in the upper left was slowly blinking.

Now for _some **HTML**  
torture_ .

Update: the simple HTML test above didn't turn as perfect as one could wish for. A \<br /\> tag was inserted before "torture", but that seems to be a bug in Wordpress rather than Word. Besides that, Word seems to create the "correct" tags, such as \<strong\> rather than \<b\>.
