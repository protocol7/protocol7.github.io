Well, now that both [Fredrik](http://sixx.se/nextgen) and [MÃ¥rten](http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/blog) has reminded me that I've stopped cheese blogging, I should probably do something about it. It's not like we've stopped doing our weekly cheese shopping, more like I've forgotten about writing on the topic. So, what's on the plate this week.

- **Chimay Biere:** we've had this so many times and I've covered it [before](http://protocol7.com/archives/2006/10/22/cheese-of-the-week/). Still my number one favorite.
- **Montbriac:** I've never had this one before but it was a very pleasant surprise. [Pitch black rind](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kohler/320740841/), beatiful runny white on the inside. It's a blue cheese made out of cow milk made in the same dairy that create another of my favorites, St Agur. While containing blue mold, you almost not even notice since the taste it blends excellent with the cheese. Montbriac is now on the top three of my favorites.
- [**Robiola Lombardia:**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robiola) described at our local cheese shop as a luxury replacement for&nbsp;Taleggio. We've had this before, but this week we got a unusually firm piece which I really liked. 

If you like to read more on cheeses, I recommend reading [this column in San Francisco Chronicle](http://www.sfgate.com/wine/cheesecourse/archive/) (also available as a [feed](http://www.sfgate.com/rss/feeds/jfletcher.xml)). If you found you're way here and are only interested in the cheese postings (who would blame you :-), you can subscribe the cheese-only-stuff [here](http://protocol7.com/archives/category/cheese/feed).
