[Rumour](http://www.gamespot.com/news/2006/03/24/news_6146578.html) has it that a future Grand Theft Auto might be in the form of a multiplayer game. Just yesterday I finished all the main missions of GTA3 San Andreas (some 77% completion over all). Networked or not, I can't wait to get my hands on the next sequel. GTA3 SA was by far the best game I've ever played. And with 100+ main missions, 100+ races and tons of other optional missions, it's hard to get more bang for the bucks.

Now, on to [Shadow of the Colossus](http://www.shadowofthecolossus.com/).
