There has, of course, been a lot of discussion about Rotor, the code released by Microsoft. It mostly deals with the fact that they uses the word "patents" in the licens.The Mono people simply [wont look](http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-March/004262.html) at the code since that might make them subject to patent infringement.

O'Reilly has a [pretty interesting article](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2002/03/27/archtour.html) on the structure of Rotor  
You can find a technical discussion on Rotor at [this list](http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A1=ind0203d&L=dotnet-rotor&D=0).
