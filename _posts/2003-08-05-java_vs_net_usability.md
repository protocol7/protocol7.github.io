[From java.net](http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/292):

> Please pardon me for saying this, but most Java apps look shabby compared with other desktop apps. Java now has a reputation for shabby-looking apps on the client-side. Swing was supposed to address this and has failed. IBMs SWT comes closer but still hasn't really challenged native MS technologies on the client.

Really, what's the problem with Java and GUIs? Microsoft has been able to build more then one good GUI framework for Windows, why can't someone build one for Java? Of course, I understand the issue with multiple platforms but common.
