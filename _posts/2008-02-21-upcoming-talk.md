Looks like I will be talking at ApacheCon EU in April. Originally, [Peter Royal was supposed to give a talk](http://eu.apachecon.com/eu2008/program/talk/2490) on [Apache MINA](http://mina.apache.org/) but had to cancel his appearance. Instead, I will try to fill his shoes. The topic is still the same, a high level overview of MINA 2.0 and a walk through on how to write a simple application using MINA. If you'll be at ApacheCon and want to meet up for a beer or got some thoughts on what would be interesting to cover in the presentation, feel free to get [in touch](mailto:niklas@protocol7.com).

This will be my first ApacheCon, a conference I've been wanting to visit for some years now. Happy to be going. I hope to meet some of the Apache people one has gotten to know from the community.
