[As noted by MÃ¥rten](http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/blog/2006/04/07/zystems-donates-to-open-source/), at work we have decided to give some back to the open source community. We're quite heavy users of open source software, both for our internal systems (e.g. Ubuntu, Subversion, Apache, Tomcat, Maven) and our software (e.g. Spring, Hibernate, commons). As a way of showing our gratitude we will be donating money to projects voted by our employees a couple of times per year.

Of course, as hopefully nice citizens we also try to contribute back improvements made on software we use, but that goes without saying :-)
