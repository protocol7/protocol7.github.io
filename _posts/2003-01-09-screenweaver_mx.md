[Screenweaver MX](http://www.screenweavermx.com/index.cfm?nav=0 "Screenweaver MX")  
 : <q cite="http://www.screenweavermx.com">Screenweaver MX is an extension to MacromediaÂ® Flash MX" that aims at providing Flash developers with a toolset to produce rich media desktop applications</q>.

Looks pretty impressive, particulary the COM abilities.

A few screenshots of application made with it: [1](http://www.muzakdeezign.com/downloads/swmx/launcher.jpg), [2](http://www.muzakdeezign.com/downloads/swmx/mp3player.jpg), [3](http://www.muzakdeezign.com/downloads/swmx/rss_tray.jpg).
