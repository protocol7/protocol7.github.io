This Tuesday sees the first [Scandinavian Developers Conference](http://www.scandevconf.se/) here in GÃ¶teborg. For a newcomer conference, the speakers and subjects they've been able to attract [seems quite impressive](http://www.scandevconf.se/conference/detailed-program/). I'll be there talking on REST in general and [JAX-RS](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311) in particular. It's a new talk for me, so I've been busy preparing (surprised every time how long it takes to get some slides done) and hopefully it will turn out okay. If you're there, please come by and say hi.
