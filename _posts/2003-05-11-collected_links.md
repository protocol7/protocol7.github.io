Lots of interesting things the last couple of days:

- [The new features of Java 1.5 are being outlined](http://java.sun.com/features/2003/05/bloch_qa.html). This time Java is really trying to catch up with C#. Most developers are excitied about [generics](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr014/) and while I think this is probably the most important feature in 1.5, [typesafe enums](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/tiger/enum.html) is what I miss the most in the daily Java coding.
- Nikhil Kothari, development lead on ASP.NET got a [blog](http://www.nikhilk.net/). [Subscribed](http://www.nikhilk.net/Rss.ashx?id=1)
- [CSS Zen garden](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/) is an interesting and beautiful CSS experiment
- [Next version of XmlReader will be simpler to subclass](http://www.tkachenko.com/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=23). Thanks!
- [Roy](http://dotnetweblogs.com/rosherove/posts/6868.aspx) thinks [Expresso](http://www12.brinkster.com/ultrapico/Expresso.htm) rocks. Agreed, I use it every day and it's a great time saver.
- [Lots of discussions on profiling and standardizing RSS](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1394.html). I think this is a great idea. Tons of interesting [discussions](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-05-11T12:13:16Z) have been going on at [different](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/10/RSS-std) [blogs](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/05/a_proposal_rss_.shtml), I hope it will continue at OASIS so that we can get a good spec for RSS that everyone can use and that is not owned by any one vendor.
- [POPFile is project of the month at SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/potm/potm-2003-05.php). I've been using POPFile to filter my spam the last three months. I now got 99.36% accuracy which must be pretty good :-) Now I'm stepping up to use it to sort my friendly mail according to interest and other weaker patterns. It will be very interesting to see how far POPFile can help me.
- [A new XHTML 2.0 working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/). [Tantek got the goods](http://tantek.com/log/2003/05.html#L20030508t1620).
