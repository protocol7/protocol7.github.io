I agree on everything Sam Ruby says [about namespaces and RSS 2.0](http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/09/28.html#a859). And isn't it just a bit bold to call it RSS 2.0. It's basically a big pile of elements added, trying to do what RSS 1.0 already can do with modules. In a less structured fashion. I just don't understand it.
