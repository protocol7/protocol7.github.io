Nick Bradbury who is the creator of Homesite and the wonderful Topstyle is currently building a RSS reader, called [FeedDemon](http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/). The screenshots looks promising and judging from his previous work I think it's safe to say that FeedDemon will be high-quality stuff. Can wait to try it out.
