The word on [SharpReader](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/06.html#000056) is spreading through the weblogging world today. I already switched Newzcrawler for it and I like it very much. So, now there's at least four different .NET apps for aggregating RSS feeds (SharpReader, Aggie, RssBandit, Harvester). It will be very interesting to see what this "competition" will lead to.

[Brad Wilson has some comments](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/002865.shtml) on these new aggregators as well. I would certainly agree with him that having the possibility of using Gecko for the HTML rendering would be great. [Luke](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/), can we have that? :-)
