Great feedback on the [pepper grinder post](http://protocol7.com/archives/2006/11/06/pepper-grinder/). Several commenters suggested the Peugot grinders, something I had already been looking at myself. So, I went out and got me one. It wasn't cheap, but damn it grinds well. Six levels of grain size, nice heavy feel and 25 years or warranty. Can't go wrong with that.

Now I just need to salt grinder as well :-)
