The SVG WG at W3C has updated the [SVG test suite](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/). The former had some issues with some tests having errors. No change log but hopefully are the tests working better now.

They also updated the [implementation status](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20030813/status/matrix.html). ASV6 is well on it's way to all-green. Let's hope they can nail the last ones.
