IBM are running a series of articles on process modelling and integration best practises using the IBM WBI stack (MQ, WBI SF, WBI Modeller). The [index page](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-odbpsum.html) contains links to new articles as they are published, [part 5](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-odbp5/index.html?ca=drs-tp0405) is out but not yet on the index page.

IBM's integration products has been going through a major change the last couple of years, and more to come. Some years ago all they had was MQSeries, after buying NEON and Crossworlds they had solutions for message brokering (WBI Message Broker) as well as advanced process integration (InterChange Server). Now, with WBI Server Foundation they are consolidating much of their product family into a more homogeneous stack based on a common runtime (WAS). I think that there are interesting times ahead.
