.NET Magazine has a very interesting [interview](http://www.fawcette.com/dotnetmag/2002_07/online/netalternatives/default.asp) with Miguel de Icaza. He predicts that Mono will ship to full .NET implementation (with all framework classes) in June 2003. [via [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/07/16/1813221)]
