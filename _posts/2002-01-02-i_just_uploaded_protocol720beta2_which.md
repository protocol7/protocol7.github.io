I just uploaded [protocol7.2.0.beta2](http://www.protocol7.com/) which is the new and improved version of protocol7. It has a very different look from the previous version (which is taken down at the moment but might be back later in the archive) and is much easier for us the extend.

The site is built on a XML/XSL backend to make the content design-independent. At the moment there is both limited content and functionality but both will evolve pretty rapidly the next couple of days.

Hope you like it! :-)
