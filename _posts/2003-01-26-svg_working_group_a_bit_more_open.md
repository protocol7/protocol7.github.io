The SVG working group over at W3C has always been really good at replying on public forums and been responsive to feedback. But, the charter has been confidential which has made it a bit hard to know what their aim with SVG has been.

Now, this has changed. The [charter is now public](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/SVGcharter2.html) and [a roadmap for future SVG versions](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Roadmap.html) has been published.
