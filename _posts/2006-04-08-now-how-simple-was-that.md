We had an old printer stuffed away on the store. It connects via the parallell port and Evas laptop doesn't have one. So, we've been printing through my laptop which only happens to be available when I'm home. So, I wanted to hook the printer up to the Ubuntu box we have for storing files and serving up some other stuff (like subversion). I started reading through some articles on how to configure Samba to do this. But it required a fair amount of hackery. Then, I found this [wonderful howto describing how to set it up using only CUPS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWinXP). Took something like 3 minutes and works like a charm. Dead simple.
