For a long time I've been unhappy with the URL scheme that MT comes with (and that I've used for protocol7). Lately there's been a [lot of discussion on URLs in the blogging world](http://www.ashbykuhlman.net/blog/2003/07/27/2227) so I decided that it was time for action.

Since my site runs on IIS I couldn't use [the mighty .htaccess tricks that Mark uses](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/15/slugs). And I wasn't too happy with using [URLs with hh:mm:ss as Mar does](http://mar.anomy.net/entry/2003/06/22/17.15.00/). So, I ended up with a combination of both. Most of the tricks are from Mar but the URL scheme is closer to Marks. Redirects from the old URLs are done using meta refresh. A few hours work and everything has been converted, MT is such a great and powerful tool.
