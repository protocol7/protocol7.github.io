I've set up a [(n)echo feed](http://www.protocol7.com/necho.xml) for protocol7. [My MT template](http://protocol7.com/mttemplates/necho.txt) is based on Mark Pilgrim's template with a few changes:

- Uses XHTML instead of HTML for the content
- Put a prefix on the (n)echo elements to make it easy to insert the XHTML

I'll keep the template updated as (n)echo evolves. The MT template is free to use if you like it.

I also added an image that links to it. It's a slightly modified version of [Nick Wetegrove](http://spilled.net/)'s image from the [(n)echo wiki](http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/EchoEnabled?action=highlight&value=button).
