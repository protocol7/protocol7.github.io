SourceForge got a bunch of [build servers](http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=10472&group_id=1), many donated from companies such as Compaq and Apple. How about Microsoft donating a server for C# compilation? Wouldn't cost a lot of money and would offer great support for the open-source comminity.
