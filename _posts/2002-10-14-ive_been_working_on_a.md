I've been working on a new version of protocol7.com. The current version uses a set of XML files, a few XSLT stylesheets and ASP to blend it all together. The new version will use pretty much the same XML (a few optimizations), a better XSLT and ASP.NET to make it simpler to edit the site and increase the performance. It will also have a new look. I just uploaded [a preview](http://www.protocol7.com/p7.2.1/) of the new look and structure (view source). It will work best in Mozilla, fairly good in IE and degrade in older browsers. Please [tell me](mailto:niklas@protocol7.com) what you think and report any bugs or things I can do better.
