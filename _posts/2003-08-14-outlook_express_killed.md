[MS has confirmed that they will release no further versions of Outlook Express](http://www.zdnet.com.au/newstech/ebusiness/story/0,2000048590,20277192,00.htm) [[via Early and Adopter](http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/2003/08/13.html#a425)]. The free products from MS seems to be killed one after the other. How long would you bet on for Messenger?

I'm a happy [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/) user, you could be too.
