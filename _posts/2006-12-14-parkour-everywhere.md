What's up with all the worlds marketing people simultaneously deciding that [parkour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour) should the theme for their new campaign? Right now there are three music videos and four commericials all using parkour. Now,&nbsp;parkour is&nbsp;cool and all, but come on. Do the marketing guys all meat up in a convention somewhere to decide on what's the latest hot thing and then all go home to film it?
