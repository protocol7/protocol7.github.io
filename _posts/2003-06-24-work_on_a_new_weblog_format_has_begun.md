[Sam Ruby has started the work to get people to finally agree on one weblog format](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RoadMap). Juding from the infected debates on RSS 1.0 vs. RSS 2.0 the last year or so this is much needed. Lots of people has stated their support for his work, could this finally be a success?

Webloggers unite, at last.
