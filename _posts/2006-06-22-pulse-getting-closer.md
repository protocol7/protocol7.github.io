A few weeks ago [I blogged](http://www.protocol7.com/archives/2006/05/29/got-pulse/) about the newest build server in town, [Pulse](http://zutubi.com/products/pulse/). All in all it looked very promising for matching our requirements for work. Two major things was missing, [dependent builds](http://jira.zutubi.com/browse/CIB-412) and [LDAP authentication](http://jira.zutubi.com/browse/CIB-352). Now both seems to be implemented, I just have to wait for 1.1 being released :-)
