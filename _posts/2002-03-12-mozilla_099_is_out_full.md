[Mozilla 0.99](http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla0.9.9) is out. Full screen mode is now supported on Windows.... why? They have the ability the block popup, but add support for full screen. That's funny.

MathML now ships with Mozilla, hopefully SVG will as well soon. [SOAP support](http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/extensions/xmlextras/docs/Soap_Scripts_in_Mozilla.html) as also included,
