[DENG](http://claus.packts.net/deng/) is getting ready for release. The final version will support CSS2, CSS3 Namespaces, SVG Tiny, XHTML Mobile Profile, XForms, XFrames.

If they can really deliver full support for those standards, DENG will be truely amazing and a very interesting way to deliver web applications. The SVG support so far looks promising but it's still way too slow for anything real. Claus (the creator of DENG) however posted on svg-developers that it's much faster in the Flash 7 player. I'm keeping my hopes up.
