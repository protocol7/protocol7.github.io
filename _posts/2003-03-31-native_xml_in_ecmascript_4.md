Looks like the next version of ECMAScript (a.k.a JavaScript) will come with [native XML types](http://www1.internetwire.com/iwire/release_html_b1?release_id=52349). The [syntax actually looks really, really neat.](http://dev2dev.bea.com/articles/JSchneider_XML.jsp) I'm sure this will be very popular with developers who find XSLT a bit complex.
