[Bioinformatics in Perl](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/01/02/bioinf.html?page=1) - a very interesting (but a bit shallow) article for a person like me. I got a master in molecular biology (actually halfway done with my PhD) and is now working with software development. Some day I hope to be able to combine these two areas. I don't think I will do it with Perl but the knowledge from the [Bioperl project](http://www.bioperl.org) will for sure be a great use.
