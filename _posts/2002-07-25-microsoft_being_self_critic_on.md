Microsoft being [self](http://news.com.com/2100-1001-946087.html?legacy=cnet&tag=pt.rss..feed.ne_20184282) [critic](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/23/26365.html) on .NET marketing. Well, no surprise.

Other things covered during yesterdays MS seminar was Yukon (next SQL Server), update for VS.NET coming this autumn, some new .NET servers coming along and more. Nothing really new and exciting.
