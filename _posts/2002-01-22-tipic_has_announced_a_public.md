Tipic has [announced](http://www.tipic.com/blog/tw32js%40tipic.com/1.1 - beta test) a public beta test of their Windows Jabber server. I've tried it a little bit already and it's looking pretty cool. From their docs it will be extensiable via COM which is way cool. This will be a major break for Jabber.
