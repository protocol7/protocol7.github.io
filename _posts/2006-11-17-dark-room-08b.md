The wonderful full screen editor [Dark Room](http://they.misled.us/dark-room/) as just gotten slightly better. [Version 0.8b](http://they.misled.us/archives/587) is out with nice looking highlightning. If you'r like me and get really easily distracted while trying to write prose (I can focus when writing code), you should probably try out Dark Room or one of it's [similar](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom) [friends](http://www.codealchemists.com/jdarkroom/).
