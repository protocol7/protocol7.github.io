Today I was creating a spiced up version of the TCP connection state diagram from [RFC 793](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt) for some documentation. It turned out pretty nicely so I thought I should post it here. It's a 1-to-1 conversion of the diagram in the RFC. The theme is based on the [very nice GTD wallpapers](http://anabubula.com/content/3-more-GTD-wallpapers). Drawn in Visio, [source available here](http://protocol7.com/svn/public/graphics/tcp-connection-state-diagram.vsd)

[![TCP connection state diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2718114758_395001dc82.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/protocol7/2718114758/sizes/o/).

Click for a full size version. If there is any interest, I'll provide a SVG version as well.

Feel free to comment with feedback and corrections.
