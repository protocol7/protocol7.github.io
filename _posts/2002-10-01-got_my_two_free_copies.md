Got my two free copies of [SVG Unleashed](http://www.sams.com/catalog/product.asp?product_id={4D37A6DE-A63D-44AD-BA23-8278F6FA7E85}) today, the paper version. It huge, 1100+ pages. And that's without the 300 page reference that is/will be downloadable from Sams.

Pretty cool feeling holding the real version of a book you worked on for some time. Hope people will like it.
