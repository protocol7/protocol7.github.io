The [XML Query](http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/) WG has [announced](http://www.stylusstudio.com/xmldev/200606/post40140.html) what they belive is the completed release of the test suite for XQuery. All in all, it contains a whopping 14500 test cases. That's what the WG think is necessary to fully test the complete specification, all 239 pages of it. I think it will be a crucial tool for ensuring combability between different XQuery implementations and might make XQuery skip the long period of incompability that most other specifications has to endure. I just wish that the SVG WG would make the same prioritizes, instead of trying to release yet another bloated spec long before the previous is [even close to being proven](http://eric.van-der-vlist.com/blog/2546_Too_many_SVG_profiles.item) and successful.

And, if 14500 test cases are required for XQuery compability, [how many will be](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/21/WS-Research) [needed for WS-\*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Web_service_specifications)?
