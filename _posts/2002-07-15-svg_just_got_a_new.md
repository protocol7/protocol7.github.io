SVG just got a new viewer: BitFlash (one of the authors of the SVG spec) just [released a alpha-version](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/svg-developers/message/18970) of their [SVG-tiny viewer](http://www.BitFlash-Activated.com). Looks good! Can't wait to see this in mobile devices, to bad I don't have a PocketPC.
