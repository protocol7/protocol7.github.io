[Don Box replying to Dave](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwsdl/html/boxwsdl.asp?frame=true) on WSDL. I agree with him, I think that maybe the biggest weakness with Javascript is its lack of typing. But [Javascript 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/js20/libraries/types.html) that problem is getting a solution. But of course, it will take 5+ years before we can use that for a wide browser audience.

But for server side apps we already have [JScript.Net](http://webdeveloper.earthweb.com/webjs/article/0,,12721_944871,00.html) which adds most of the new stuff in JS2.0 (types, classes, constants, packages and more). JS is going seriously powerful within the next couple of years.
