webstandards.org is [reporting](http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2002_07.html#a000062) some absolutely great news: Lycos Europe is moving to a new design (preview [here](http://jscript.dk/lycos/2/)), totally based on XHTML 1.0 transitional and CSS. Way cool, this is the first large (as measured in hits) that is doing this move. Who's next?
