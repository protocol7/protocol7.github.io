[Tantek](http://www.tantek.com/log/2002/11.html#blog20021124t1454) , [Scott Andrew](http://www.scottandrew.com/weblog/2002_11#a000469) and a few others wants to use XHTML instead of RSS. Sounds good.

I don't think a BLOGPOST element should be used. The site summary are just another use of XHTML, the fact that something (any element) is a blogpost is a property. Setting a class fits very good.

Allright, who will define this format?
