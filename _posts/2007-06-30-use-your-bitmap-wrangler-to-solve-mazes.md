[This has got to be one of the cutest tricks I've seen](http://taint.org/2007/06/19/121541a.html). A few years ago I wrote a simple Flash script that solved any similar (two openings on the outer wall) maze using [an A\* algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2A), probably got it laying around somewhere. Doing it in Gimp beats it tough.
